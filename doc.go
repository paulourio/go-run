/*
Package urn implements the canonical parser for URNs, according to
[IETF's RFC 8141](urn:ietf:rfc:8141).

A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
that is assigned under the "urn" URI scheme and a particular URN
namespace, with the intent that the URN will be a persistent,
location-independent resource identifier.
